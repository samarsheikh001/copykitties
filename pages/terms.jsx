                <h3>Your Order Cancellation Rights</h3>
                <p>
                  Any Goods you purchase can only be returned in accordance with
                  these Terms and Conditions and Our Returns Policy. Our Returns
                  Policy forms a part of these Terms and Conditions. Please read
                  our Returns Policy to learn more about your right to cancel
                  Your Order. Your right to cancel an Order only applies to
                  Goods that are returned in the same condition as You received
                  them. You should also include all of the products
                  instructions, documents and wrappings. Goods that are damaged
                  or not in the same condition as You received them or which are
                  worn simply beyond opening the original packaging will not be

                  purchased Goods while they are in Your possession. We will
                  reimburse You no later than 14 days from the day on which We
                  receive the returned Goods. We will use the same means of
                  payment as You used for the Order, and You will not incur any
                  fees for such reimbursement. You will not have any right to
                  cancel an Order for the supply of any of the following Goods:
                  The supply of Goods made to Your specifications or clearly
                  personalized. The supply of digital content which is not
                  supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun
                  with Your prior express consent and You have acknowledged Your
                  loss of cancellation right.
                </p>

                  time prior to accepting an Order. The prices quoted may be
                  revised by the Company subsequent to accepting an Order in the
                  event of any occurrence affecting delivery caused by
                  government action, variation in customs duties, increased
                  shipping charges, higher foreign exchange costs and any other
                  matter beyond the control of the Company. In that event, You
